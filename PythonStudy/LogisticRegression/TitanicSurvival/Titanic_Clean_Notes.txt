1. Columns that are dropped already
--------------------------------
1.1. PassengerId – this is a unique incrementing number, it should not influence the ‘risk’
1.2. Name – I don’t really want to know if people called Bob are more likely to survive than someone called Dave, plus we don’t have enough data to support this.
1.3. Ticket – Looks messy, and for similar reasons to PassengerId
